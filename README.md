### Hello everyone You can watch a video about creating my game for Aleo.

## Aleo Jump 
Aleo Jump is a fun and dynamic game in which you can jump on platforms. The game was created using the Unity platform and optimized for Android devices.

## How to play
In order to start the game, you need to download the apk file and install it on your smartphone or tablet. Then start the game and play gaining points.Your task is to control a character who is constantly jumping up, and help him reach as high as possible.

## How to help the project
If you want to add something to the game or use my code to create your game, you need to download the unity file and open it in the Unity program. There you can view and change all the elements of the game, such as graphics, sound, physics, levels and so on. You can also export the game to other formats or platforms. I will be glad to see your ideas and suggestions for improving the game. You can contact me via github or by email.

Thank you for your interest in my project! I hope you enjoy playing Halo Jump! ðŸ˜Š
